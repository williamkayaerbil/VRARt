# VRARt

I am going to work through the work of instamuseum.com to learn how to build an AR Android app that places a museumn of Instagram images in a physical location.  Download these models and commited them to GitHub.  I will try to stream line the code and work through a way to adapt the code to a linux server.  The origional code was written on Mac.
